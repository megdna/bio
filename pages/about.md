<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">BioShack</a> is a business incubator and think tank where bioneers and citizen scientists come together to build apps and hacks that better our world. The organization supports a <abbr title="Do It Yourself">DIY</abbr> culture where information and technology are shared freely for the purpose of developing socially responsible solutions.

The collective was founded by <a href="https://megdna.github.io" target="_blank">Megan</a> in early 2011 at the beginning of the open science movement and was one of the first biohackerspaces in the San Francisco Bay Area. Many of the projects here came out of that original idea accelerator and members of this “citizen science brigade” are still active in the <abbr title="Free Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr> community.
